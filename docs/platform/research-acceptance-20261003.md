# Research acceptance checkpoint — 2026-10-03

Branch `fix/TA-R01-research-quality`, source
`c705cad32c3e6579c94942d8131ea32f0ac34def`. Private platform candidate remains
incomplete; Draft PR #7 remains draft. No deployment, provider/risk-limit
change, historical rewrite, worker restart or paid/vendor call.

## R08 recovery fingerprint construction prerequisite

New internal `recovery_fingerprint.py` is not wired to the worker, API or CLI.
It constructs a separate digest; existing API config_hash and immutable run
history remain unchanged. Owner/run/instrument/as-of/ordered analysts, source
IDs/freshness and revalidated payload hashes bind to the original request.
The digest includes source manifests, full portfolio/policy content, rendered
book, risk-source content hashes, language/allowance, effective configuration,
native graph options/analyst plan, supplied resolved-client descriptors,
actual Python-package source bytes and installed runtime/dependency versions.

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity construction / mismatch rejection | PASS | 44 focused tests, 5.47 s: effective config/model/provider/endpoint, owner/instrument/date/roles, source changes/corruption/future availability, original run/allowance/prompt, runtime, risk and full book/policy binding |
| Existing JSON codec coupling | PASS | Changed risk-round fingerprint rejects previously encoded checkpoint before model reentry; client factory explicitly forbidden in this test |
| Privacy and relocation | PASS | Returns digest only, no SDK/network initialization. Credential-bearing/invalid URLs and common credential fields/unknown config keys rejected; fixed error text. Output/cache/memory paths do not change research identity; no CLI memory read |
| Actual runtime identity | PASS | Source-byte changes alter digest without changing Git HEAD or package version; Python and installed distribution versions bind. Package-source symlinks rejected, no env/credential file read |
| Full local Python | PASS | `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q --disable-warnings`: 1,924 tests + 88 subtests, 20 skips, 22 warnings, 131.46 s; Python 3.14.7/macOS, clean c705cad source throughout gate |
| Ruff/diff/templates | PASS | `.venv/bin/ruff check .`, `git diff --check`, Ruby issue-template YAML load |
| PostgreSQL/optional providers | UNVERIFIED | Same 18 PostgreSQL, missing Bedrock dependency and live DeepSeek-key gates skipped |
| Web/CLI activation or live acceptance | NOT_IN_SCOPE | New internal prerequisite only; no frontend change, new recovery route, queue retry, supervisor integration or runtime restart |
| Trusted resolved-client attestation | UNVERIFIED | Mandatory descriptor binds endpoint/class/non-secret effective SDK-option hashes, but caller supplies it. Actual client initialization must derive/attest these fields before production use |
| Durable authorized recovery | UNVERIFIED | Owner-readable load/authentication, checkpoint-byte integrity, state/context validation, parent lease-fenced synchronous commit/ack, continuation consent and retained accounting remain open |
| Financial/MT acceptance | UNVERIFIED | No live report produced; earlier manual semantic/editorial failures unchanged |
| NQ=F | BLOCKED | Owner's contract/roll-source hold unchanged; no substitute |

Fingerprint equality is not authentication, a signature, policy approval, source
coverage proof or permission to spend. Full risk-series semantics still require
the existing replay checks; rendered book must be constructed from trusted DB
instrument mappings. Hashing both supplied inputs does not attest their origin.
Actual initialized-client settings must be observed, not invented from API
declarations or supplied by browser/model content. No worker path consumes this
component yet; no exhausted allowance is reset or increased.

The runtime digest deliberately invalidates on any package-Python or installed
distribution-version change. Restore a compatible environment on another
machine; do not waive this conservatively broad identity check. Synthetic test
fixtures establish binding mechanics, not provider billing, determinism,
investment correctness or release readiness. The full R01–R14 goal remains open.

Next: derive trusted effective-client descriptors, then integrate the private
durable saver and supervised parent commit/ack, preserving execution_started
and explicit continuation consent. See `research-recovery-contract.md` and
`HANDOFF.md`; older dated receipts remain immutable.
